## Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to capture hand signs via a webcam, label these images, and then train a deep learning model to recognize various sign language gestures. The model is then tested in real-time to assess its accuracy and effectiveness.

This project follows these steps, which guides you through the entire process from data collection to real-time prediction.

## Features

- **Image Capture**: Capture hand sign images using a webcam or any image source.
- **Image Labeling**: Use the `labelImg` tool to label the captured images.
- **Model Training**: Train a custom deep learning model using the labeled data.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Implement real-time hand sign detection using the trained model.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sarvesh3959/Real-Time-Sign-Language-Detection.git
   cd Real-Time-Sign-Language-Detection
